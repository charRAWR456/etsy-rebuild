          databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
          storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
          messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
6. paste this information in your api-key.ts
          export var masterFirebaseConfig = {

          ...

          };
7. import database file located in project folder to firebase
8. type npm install in your terminal
9. After npm install is finished, type ng serve -o
